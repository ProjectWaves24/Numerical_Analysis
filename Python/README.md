# Numerical_Analysis / Python

Python modules for solution of different problems of numerical analysis  such that

* solution of linear equations and system of linear equations
* solution of least squares problems
* interpolation
* integration
* solution of nonlinear equations and systems of nonlinear equations
* solution of ODE and systems of ODE.

This code is translated version  to Python   of  MATLAB's code located in   https://github.com/ProjectWaves24/Numerical_Analysis/
Translation to Python was performed  in 2022 by 	
Erik Samuelsson  and  Louis Dao, students at the course MMG410.
